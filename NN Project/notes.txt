Neural Network Project Notes
Project Overview
This project involves creating a neural network from scratch using NumPy. The neural network is designed for classification tasks and includes functionality for forward propagation, backward propagation, training, and prediction.

Key Components
Neural Network Class (neuro.py)
Running tests: (test.py, test2.py)
Image generators: (image.py, and image2.py)

Initialization: Defines the structure of the network with specified layer sizes.
Activation Functions: Implements ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions along with their derivatives.
Forward Propagation: Computes the outputs of each layer given the input data.
Backward Propagation: Calculates gradients to update weights and biases.
Training: Uses forward and backward propagation to train the network over a specified number of epochs.
Prediction: Outputs predictions for given input data based on the trained model.
Visualization (image.py)

Neural Network Visualization: Draws the architecture of the neural network using Matplotlib.
Node and Edge Layout: Positions nodes and edges to represent the neural network layers and connections.
Customization: Limits the number of nodes displayed per layer to improve readability for large networks and adjusts spacing and transparency to reduce clutter.
Challenges and Solutions
Indexing Errors: Adjusted backward propagation loop to handle indexing correctly.
Visualization Clutter: Limited the number of nodes per layer and adjusted spacing to make the neural network visualization clearer and more informative.
Example Usage
test.py: Script to test the neural network with a simple XOR problem. Demonstrates network training and prediction.
image.py: Script to visualize the neural network architecture.
Example Output
Training Output: Displays cost reduction over epochs, indicating the training process.
Visualization Output: Shows the network architecture, highlighting the structure of input, hidden, and output layers.
Next Steps
Further Testing: Explore the network's performance with different datasets and configurations.
Optimization: Implement additional features such as different activation functions, regularization techniques, and more advanced optimization algorithms.
Improved Visualization: Enhance visualization to support larger networks and provide more detailed insights.
