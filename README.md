Overview
This project involves building a neural network from scratch using NumPy. The neural network is designed for classification tasks and includes functionalities for forward propagation, backward propagation, training, prediction, and visualization.

Features
Customizable Architecture: Define the neural network structure with any number of layers and nodes.
Activation Functions: Includes ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions.
Training: Implements forward and backward propagation for training the network.
Visualization: Visualize the neural network architecture using Matplotlib.

Usage
  Testing the Neural Network:

    1- The test.py script demonstrates training the neural network with a simple XOR problem. For an improved version with the if __name__ == "__main__" clause, see test2.py.

  Visualizing the Neural Network:

    2- The image.py script visualizes the neural network architecture. For an improved version that handles large numbers of nodes in hidden layers, see image2.py.
